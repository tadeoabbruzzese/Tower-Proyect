    "description": "Throw all the dice in your hand, with different numbers resulting in different effects. Throwing dice while in combat will grant you **1** of **10** buffs at random, and will be cleared once you leave combat. Possible effects include **5%** Elemental Damage (Ice, Flame, Volt, Physical, Aberrant) and **5%** Reduced Elemental Damage Received (Ice, Flame, Volt, Physical, Aberrant). Each unique effect can only stack **1** time. Gain **1** die every **30** seconds, up to **3** dice. Cannot be used with **Couant** or **Couant II**.\n\nWhen rolling **1** die, immediately gain **180** weapon charge. Rolling **1** or **6** will grant the Thermonuclear buff: **20%** damage increase for **35** seconds.\n\nWhen rolling **2** dice, immediately gain **180** weapon charge and gain the Thermonuclear buff. If both dice land on the same number, gain the **Fusion** effect: clear all weapon skill cooldowns.\n\nWhen rolling **3** dice, immediately gain **180** weapon charge, gain the Thermonuclear buff and Fusion effect, and if all dice land on the same number, gain the **Overclock** effect: for the next **6** seconds, discharge skills will not consume weapon charge.\n\nWhen unequipping the Chosen Dice relic, the random effect and thermonuclear effect are removed.",
