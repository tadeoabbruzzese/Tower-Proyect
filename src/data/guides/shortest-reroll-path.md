Rerolling consists of starting over on new accounts until you obtain the weapon that you want.

Although you get many Gold Nuclei while playing the game, **it is never guaranteed that you will get the weapon that you want.** You can buy copies of weapons with [black market tokens](/guides/gacha), but only if you have one copy of that weapon to begin with.

**All Gold Nuclei on the map below are available day 1**, without doing the story quest beyond getting the fire bow. However, you need to level up to claim the pre-registration rewards, and the story is the fastest way to level up.

> Note that if you claim the pre-registration rewards (after getting the free gold nucleus), you can reroll very quickly, in about 15-30 minutes. These rewards are available for 180 days from the release date (August 10, 2022).

This path is optimized for low levels. Astra (starting region) has a few more gold nuclei available on day 1, however the elite monsters guarding them are extremely powerful if you do not level up.

## Optional Advanced Map

The story takes a (relatively) long amount of time. I will update the guide if I find a faster way to obtain the remaining gold nuclei. In my experience it takes over 1.5 hours to reroll while completing the day 1 story quest, whereas that time could be cut in half if you could skip it.

The time gate on exploration points are based on *account age*, therefore if you created an account on a day 1 and waited until day 3+ to reroll, you could do it much faster.

The methods in this guide do not consume dark crystals.
