Vitality is consumed when claiming rewards for certain dungeons. You can **store up to 180 VIT**, and it recovers at a rate of **1 VIT/8 minutes** (24 hours to recover from 0 to 180).

In China, Max VIT is **360** and it recovers at the same rate (48 hours from 0 to 360). 

## Vitality Dungeons
All dungeons consume **30 VIT per run**, while Joint Operation consumes **30 VIT <i>per chest</i>** (3 chests + free bonus chest).

All Vitality dungeons will give you Blue/Purple/Gold Energy Dust that you can use to purchase useful things.

| Content | Rewards | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Joint Operation | Armor, Matrices | 1-4 player dungeon that consists of mobs and two bosses. Clear each section to unlock a chest. |
| Dimensional Trials | Wep Materials, Wep EXP, Matrix EXP | 1-4 player dungeon similar to, but weaker than, Joint Operation instances. |
